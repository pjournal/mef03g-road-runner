## FINAL PROJECT 

### Project Proposal

We decided to make our exploration on the Housing Sales data of Turkey. We have contacted with TUIK-Turkish Statistical Institute with your advice for obtaining a better formatted data set than the ones on their internet site.  
What our aim is to inspect the housing sales data for at least the last 3 years with price, mortgage credits information, demographical information about the buyer and the province information as the city, district and the neighborhood.    

Variables will be as following:
- House sales by city, districts (,neighborhoods)
- Mortgaged house sales 
- House sales in detail of genders
- House sales in detail of nationality

### Learning Objectives
- Giving the data a valuable shape for analyzing.
- Inspecting data according to  province information.
- Visualizing data according to  demographical information.
- Analyzing data according to different time periods 

### Analysis Objectives
- Finding the provinces where the most number of sale is made, the average of sales over time periods.
- Analyzing the sale prices in provinces and group them by giving intervals.
- Analyzing the province preference by nationality. 
- Analyzing mortgage credits detail of sales.
